# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

## Create a new endpoint in the server.ts file

The endpoint deployed on Elastic beanstalk can be found in [this link](http://image-process-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=).
